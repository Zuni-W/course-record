## crypto analysis

Project : Find a key with hash value “ sdu _ cst _20220610” under a message composed of your name folowed by your student ID . For example ,“ San Zhan 202000460001”.

Project : Find a 64-byte message under some k fulfilling that their hash value is symmetrical .

## bitcoin

Project:research report on MPT

*Project:send a tx on Bitcoin testnet,and parse the tx data down to everybit,better write script yourself

*Project:forge a signature to pretend that you are Satoshi

*Project:report on the application of this deduce technique in Ethereum with ECDSA

*Project:verify the above pit falls with proof-of-concept code

## SM2

*Project : impl sm2 with RFC6979

*Project:Implement the above ECMH scheme Decrypt

*Project:Implement a PGP scheme with SM2

*Project:implement sm2 2P sign with real network communication

*Project:implement sm2 2P decrypt with real network communication

## SM4
Experimenting linear cryptanalysis of DES

Survey of AES implementation software impl

Survey of GCM , nonce reuse resistant , GCM - SIV · Survey of TLS Weakness 

The protocol itself : CRIME etc .

The implementation : HeartBleed , CBC related stuff 

The configuration : DROWN 

The PKI system : WoSign accident

## SM3

•Project:implement the naïve birthday attack of reduced SM3

•Project:implement the Rho method of reduced SM3

•*The longer collision you can find,the higher score

*Project:implement length extension attack for SM3,SHA256,etc.

*Project:do your best to optimize SM3 implementation(software)

*Project:Impl Merkle Tree following RFC6962
•Construct a Merkle tree with 10w leaf nodes
•Build inclusion proof for specified element
•Build exclusion proof for specified element

*Project:Try to Implement this-Generalizing Hash Chains
